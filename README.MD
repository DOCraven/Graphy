## Context
A program to assist in analysing NEW's industrial energy consumption.

## Scope

Contains:

- Code to manipulate data into DataFrames
- Code to plot the data nicely

## How to use

1. Clone the master branch 
  1.   `git clone [URL]`
1. Install Dependencies (if required - `PIP INSTALL xyz`)
1. Ensure the `xls` file is in the root folder (ie, same as `Graphy.py`)
1. run the `Graphy.py` folder either within your IDE or via `python graphy.py` in the terminal  
1. Break stuff


## Known Issues


- The plotter function requires some manual manipulation to get it to plot nicely.
